# Quickbrowse

Quickbrowse allows the user to browse through images quickly and copy images to a designated folder with a keypress.

It uses a main window with a listview, menu bar and some buttons, and a full screen mode can also be activated.

After loading an image from a folder (using the menu bar option) the listview will populate with valid image files and the selected image will be displayed.

Pressing up or down on the arrow keys will change the image respectively (as will clicking on the listview)

Pressing left or right will change folder within the parent directory. This is useful when there are multiple albums within a parent folder.

If the save path has been selected (done from settings) the currently displayed image can be copied into the designated folder by pressing enter.
